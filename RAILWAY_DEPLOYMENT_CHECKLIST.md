   ```
6. [ ] Copy your Railway URL (e.g., `https://your-app.up.railway.app`)

## ‚úÖ Post-Deployment Verification

1. [ ] Test backend health: 
   ```bash
   curl https://[your-railway-url].up.railway.app/health
   ```
   Should return: `{"status":"OK","timestamp":"..."}`

2. [ ] Check frontend: Visit your Vercel URL and try to login

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues

- **CORS Error**: Make sure `FRONTEND_URL` in Railway matches your Vercel URL exactly
- **Connection Refused**: Ensure `VITE_API_URL` has the correct Railway URL with `/api/v1`
- **401 Unauthorized**: Check that `JWT_SECRET` is set in Railway
- **Database Error**: Verify `DATABASE_URL` is correct and database is accessible

## üéâ Success Indicators

- Backend health check returns OK
- No console errors in browser
- Login form submits without connection errors
- API calls show correct Railway URL in Network tab (not localhost)
